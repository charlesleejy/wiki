### Common Network Security Threats

In today's digital landscape, networks are vulnerable to a wide variety of security threats that can lead to data breaches, financial losses, service disruptions, and reputational damage. Below are some of the most **common network security threats** and their characteristics:

### 1. **Malware (Malicious Software)**

**Malware** refers to any software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a system. Types of malware include:

- **Viruses**: Programs that attach themselves to legitimate files and replicate when executed, spreading to other files and systems.
- **Worms**: Standalone programs that replicate and spread across networks without user intervention.
- **Trojans**: Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software. Once installed, they provide unauthorized access or perform harmful activities.
- **Ransomware**: Malware that encrypts a victim’s files or systems and demands a ransom for decryption.
- **Spyware**: Software that secretly monitors and collects user data, often without the user’s knowledge.
- **Adware**: Malware that automatically displays unwanted advertisements, sometimes collecting data on user behavior.

### 2. **Phishing and Social Engineering**

**Phishing** involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, by pretending to be a legitimate entity. Techniques include:

- **Email Phishing**: Fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate organizations, often directing users to fake websites.
- **Spear Phishing**: A targeted phishing attack aimed at a specific individual or organization, often more personalized and convincing.
- **Vishing** (Voice Phishing): Using phone calls to trick individuals into revealing personal information.
- **Smishing** (SMS Phishing): Using text messages to deceive users into divulging sensitive information or installing malware.

### 3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**

A **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack** occurs when an attacker intercepts and manipulates communication between two parties without their knowledge. Common MITM attack methods include:

- **Eavesdropping**: Intercepting data transmitted over a network, such as emails, passwords, or financial transactions.
- **Session Hijacking**: Taking control of an active user session, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
- **SSL Stripping**: Downgrading an HTTPS connection to an unencrypted HTTP connection to intercept data.

### 4. **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**

**Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks aim to make a network service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic or causing it to crash. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks involve multiple devices (often part of a botnet) flooding the target with traffic.

- **Network Flooding**: Overwhelming a target with excessive requests or data packets.
- **Amplification Attacks**: Using services like DNS or NTP to send a flood of traffic to the victim by exploiting their response mechanisms.
- **Application Layer Attacks**: Targeting specific applications or services with malicious requests, causing them to become unresponsive.

### 5. **SQL Injection**

**SQL injection** is a type of attack where an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into an input field of a web application to manipulate the database. This can allow the attacker to:

- Access unauthorized data.
- Modify or delete data.
- Bypass authentication.
- Execute administrative operations on the database.

### 6. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is a web application vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. XSS can be used to:

- Steal session cookies.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Deface websites.
- Harvest user credentials or personal data.

### 7. **Password Attacks**

Password attacks aim to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by compromising credentials. Common techniques include:

- **Brute Force Attacks**: Automated attempts to guess a password by trying many combinations.
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Using a precompiled list of common passwords to guess the correct one.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using credentials obtained from previous data breaches to attempt access on other services.
- **Password Spraying**: Using a single commonly used password against many accounts to avoid detection.

### 8. **Insider Threats**

**Insider threats** refer to security risks posed by individuals within an organization, such as employees, contractors, or business partners. They can be:

- **Malicious Insiders**: Individuals who deliberately misuse their access to cause harm, such as stealing data, sabotaging systems, or leaking sensitive information.
- **Unintentional Insiders**: Employees who accidentally compromise security by falling victim to phishing attacks, misconfiguring systems, or mishandling sensitive information.

### 9. **Zero-Day Exploits**

A **zero-day exploit** targets a software vulnerability that is unknown to the software vendor or the public. Since there is no patch or defense available for these vulnerabilities, they are highly dangerous. Zero-day exploits are often sold or used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems before a fix is developed.

### 10. **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**

**Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** are prolonged and targeted cyberattacks in which an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period. APTs are usually carried out by well-funded, organized groups, often with political or economic motives.

- **Stages of an APT**: 
  1. **Initial entry** (often through phishing or exploiting a vulnerability).
  2. **Lateral movement** across the network to gather more data.
  3. **Data exfiltration** and long-term surveillance.

### 11. **DNS Spoofing/Poisoning**

**DNS Spoofing (or DNS Poisoning)** is a type of attack where corrupt DNS data is injected into a DNS resolver’s cache, causing it to return an incorrect IP address for a domain name. This can redirect users to malicious websites, where attackers can steal credentials or deliver malware.

### 12. **Rogue Access Points**

**Rogue access points** are unauthorized wireless access points installed within a network, often by attackers to bypass security controls. Once a rogue access point is established, it allows attackers to intercept network traffic, steal data, or inject malware.

### 13. **Botnets**

A **botnet** is a network of compromised computers (often referred to as **zombies**) that are controlled by an attacker to perform coordinated attacks. Botnets can be used for:

- **DDoS attacks**: Overloading a target with traffic.
- **Spam campaigns**: Sending out massive amounts of spam emails.
- **Credential harvesting**: Stealing login credentials from infected machines.

### 14. **Ransomware**

**Ransomware** is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s data and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) for the decryption key. Common methods of infection include phishing emails, drive-by downloads, and exploit kits. Failure to pay the ransom typically results in permanent data loss.

### 15. **Endpoint Security Threats**

Endpoints such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets are often targeted by attackers. Common threats include:

- **Mobile malware**: Malware specifically targeting smartphones or tablets.
- **Unpatched vulnerabilities**: Outdated software that lacks the latest security patches.
- **Physical attacks**: Stealing or tampering with devices to extract sensitive data.

### 16. **Cloud Security Threats**

With the increased use of cloud services, attackers often target vulnerabilities in cloud environments. Common cloud security threats include:

- **Misconfigured cloud storage**: Leaving cloud storage (such as AWS S3 buckets) open to public access.
- **Insecure APIs**: Exploiting poorly secured APIs used by cloud services.
- **Account hijacking**: Gaining unauthorized access to cloud accounts by compromising credentials or exploiting weaknesses.
