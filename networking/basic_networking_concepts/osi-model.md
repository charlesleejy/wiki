### What is the OSI Model and What Are the Functions of Its Layers?  

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a communication system or network. It divides the process of networking into seven distinct layers, each with specific roles.

### 1. **Physical Layer**  
   - **Function**: Transmits raw binary data (bits) over a physical medium (e.g., cables, radio frequencies).
   - **Main Tasks**: 
     - Defines the hardware equipment, media type, signal transmission, and reception.
     - Deals with electrical signals, light, or radio signals.
     - Manages bit rate control, encoding, and physical connections.
   - **Examples**: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, USB, Bluetooth.

### 2. **Data Link Layer**  
   - **Function**: Handles node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction.
   - **Main Tasks**:
     - Packages raw bits from the physical layer into frames.
     - Manages MAC (Media Access Control) and LLC (Logical Link Control).
     - Provides flow control and error handling (e.g., using cyclic redundancy checks).
   - **Examples**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, switches, MAC addresses.

### 3. **Network Layer**  
   - **Function**: Manages data transfer between different networks and handles routing.
   - **Main Tasks**:
     - Determines the best physical path for data using routing algorithms.
     - Assigns logical addresses (IP addresses).
     - Handles packet forwarding, switching, and fragmentation/reassembly of packets.
   - **Examples**: Routers, IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP (ping).

### 4. **Transport Layer**  
   - **Function**: Ensures reliable transmission of data between two devices.
   - **Main Tasks**:
     - Provides end-to-end communication and error recovery.
     - Segmentation, flow control, and reassembly of data.
     - Ensures data integrity (error correction) and manages connection establishment.
     - Manages TCP (reliable) and UDP (unreliable but faster) protocols.
   - **Examples**: TCP, UDP, port numbers.

### 5. **Session Layer**  
   - **Function**: Manages sessions between applications on different devices.
   - **Main Tasks**:
     - Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions.
     - Synchronizes data exchanges (e.g., managing checkpoints for long data transfers).
     - Controls dialogues (full-duplex or half-duplex).
   - **Examples**: NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

### 6. **Presentation Layer**  
   - **Function**: Translates, encrypts, and compresses data to ensure compatibility.
   - **Main Tasks**:
     - Data translation: Converts data formats between application and network.
     - Encryption/Decryption: Ensures data security by encrypting and decrypting messages.
     - Data compression: Reduces the size of data to optimize bandwidth usage.
   - **Examples**: SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG, ASCII.

### 7. **Application Layer**  
   - **Function**: Provides network services directly to applications and end users.
   - **Main Tasks**:
     - Facilitates user interface and interaction with network resources.
     - Protocols for network services like email, file transfer, and web browsing.
     - Handles application-specific functions, such as HTTP requests, FTP transfers.
   - **Examples**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP (email), DNS, POP3.

Each layer of the OSI model interacts with the layer directly above and below it, ensuring a structured approach to data transmission and communication across networks.
