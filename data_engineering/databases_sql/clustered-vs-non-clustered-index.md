### Difference Between Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes

**Indexes** in a database are used to speed up data retrieval operations by providing an efficient way to look up data. There are two primary types of indexes in relational databases: **clustered** and **non-clustered** indexes. These two index types have distinct characteristics and are used for different purposes in optimizing queries.

### 1. **Clustered Index**

#### **Definition**:
A **clustered index** determines the **physical order** in which the rows of a table are stored. This means that the table is physically sorted based on the column(s) defined as the clustered index. Since there can be only one physical order of the rows, a table can have **only one clustered index**.

In most databases, the **primary key** is usually defined as the clustered index by default, but you can explicitly define a different column or set of columns as the clustered index.

#### **Key Characteristics**:
- **Determines Physical Order**: The rows in the table are stored on disk in the same order as the clustered index.
- **One Per Table**: Since the physical order of the table can only follow one sort order, there can be only one clustered index per table.
- **Faster Retrieval for Range Queries**: Clustered indexes are highly efficient for retrieving a range of values or sorting data, as the data is already physically organized.

#### **Example**:
Suppose you have an `employees` table, and you create a clustered index on `employee_id` (the primary key):

```sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_employee_id ON employees(employee_id);
```

In this case, the data in the `employees` table is physically sorted by the `employee_id` column. If you perform a query like `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 100`, the database can quickly locate the row because it knows the data is physically sorted by `employee_id`.

#### **Advantages of Clustered Index**:
1. **Faster Range Queries**: Since the data is stored in the same order as the index, range queries (e.g., `BETWEEN`, `ORDER BY`) are faster.
2. **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Clustered indexes are efficient for queries that return large result sets or when data needs to be ordered by the indexed column(s).
3. **No Need for Additional Lookups**: The data and the index are stored together, so retrieving data through a clustered index does not require additional lookups.

#### **Disadvantages of Clustered Index**:
1. **Only One Per Table**: Since the clustered index defines the physical storage order of the data, only one clustered index is allowed per table.
2. **Slower Inserts/Updates**: Insertions, updates, or deletions can be slower, as they may require reorganizing the physical order of the rows when the indexed value changes.
3. **Larger Index**: Clustered indexes include the full row of data, meaning that the index itself can be large compared to non-clustered indexes, which only store pointers.

### 2. **Non-Clustered Index**

#### **Definition**:
A **non-clustered index** does not affect the physical order of the table’s rows. Instead, it creates a separate structure that holds pointers (or references) to the actual rows in the table. A table can have **multiple non-clustered indexes**, allowing you to optimize queries that need to search or sort by different columns.

The non-clustered index stores the indexed column(s) and a pointer to the corresponding data row. In cases where the clustered index exists, the pointer refers to the clustered index; otherwise, it points directly to the row on disk.

#### **Key Characteristics**:
- **Does Not Affect Physical Order**: The table’s data is not physically ordered based on a non-clustered index; instead, the index stores pointers to the data.
- **Multiple Non-Clustered Indexes**: A table can have many non-clustered indexes, which allows for optimization of different queries.
- **Pointer to Data**: The index stores the column(s) being indexed along with a pointer to the actual data row, allowing for faster lookups.

#### **Example**:
Suppose you want to create a non-clustered index on the `email` column of the `employees` table:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_employee_email ON employees(email);
```

In this case, the data in the table remains physically ordered by `employee_id` (if there is a clustered index on `employee_id`), but the non-clustered index on `email` stores the email values and pointers to the actual rows. When a query searches for a specific email, the index helps the database quickly find the matching row.

---

#### **Advantages of Non-Clustered Index**:
1. **Multiple Indexes**: You can create multiple non-clustered indexes on a table, allowing you to optimize different queries based on different columns.
2. **Faster Lookups**: Non-clustered indexes can speed up lookups for specific queries (e.g., equality searches on non-primary key columns).
3. **Smaller Index Size**: Since non-clustered indexes only store pointers to the data rather than the data itself, the index size is typically smaller than a clustered index.

#### **Disadvantages of Non-Clustered Index**:
1. **Slower for Range Queries**: Non-clustered indexes are less efficient for range queries compared to clustered indexes because the data is not physically ordered in the same way as the index.
2. **Extra Lookups**: Non-clustered indexes require an extra lookup step to retrieve the actual data from the table. The index only stores a pointer to the data, so the database must follow this pointer to retrieve the full row.
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Maintaining multiple non-clustered indexes can increase the overhead for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations, as the indexes must be updated whenever data changes.

### Key Differences Between Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes

| **Aspect**                     | **Clustered Index**                                | **Non-Clustered Index**                           |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Physical Order of Data**      | Affects the physical order of rows in the table.   | Does not affect the physical order of the table.  |
| **Number of Indexes Per Table** | Only one clustered index per table is allowed.     | Multiple non-clustered indexes can be created.    |
| **Data Storage**                | Stores the actual data in the index.               | Stores pointers (references) to the data rows.    |
| **Use Case**                    | Best for range queries, sorting, and primary key lookups. | Best for equality searches, like lookups based on specific column values. |
| **Performance for Range Queries** | Very efficient for range queries (`BETWEEN`, `ORDER BY`). | Less efficient for range queries.                 |
| **Performance for Lookups**     | Direct access to the data without additional lookups. | Requires additional lookups to retrieve data.     |
| **Impact on Data Modification** | Slower for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations as data may need to be reordered. | Less impact on data modification, but still needs to maintain index pointers. |
| **Index Size**                  | Can be larger, as it includes the actual data.     | Smaller, as it only includes pointers to the data. |

### Use Cases for Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes

#### **When to Use Clustered Indexes**:
- **Primary Key**: If the table has a primary key (which is often unique and frequently queried), you can define it as the clustered index.
- **Range Queries**: When queries frequently retrieve a range of values (e.g., finding orders within a date range), a clustered index on the date column would improve performance.
- **Sorting**: If your queries involve sorting (e.g., `ORDER BY` clauses), a clustered index can make these operations more efficient since the data is already sorted.

#### **When to Use Non-Clustered Indexes**:
- **Multiple Search Criteria**: Use non-clustered indexes when you need to optimize queries that search on non-primary key columns (e.g., finding users by email, searching for products by name).
- **Frequent Lookups**: Non-clustered indexes are ideal for optimizing equality searches on columns that are not part of the primary key (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'example@example.com'`).
- **Covering Indexes**: You can create non-clustered indexes that include additional columns to cover frequently queried data, reducing the need for extra lookups.

### Conclusion

**Clustered indexes** define the physical order of data in the table, making them ideal for primary keys, range queries, and sorting operations. However, since only one clustered index is allowed per table, it is usually created on the primary key. **Non-clustered indexes**, on the other hand, do not affect the physical order of data and can be created on multiple columns, making them ideal for optimizing lookups on secondary columns. Both types of indexes are crucial for improving query performance, but they serve different purposes and should be used based on the query patterns and needs of the database system.
