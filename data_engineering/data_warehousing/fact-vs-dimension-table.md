### Concept of a Fact Table and a Dimension Table

In a data warehouse, the **fact table** and **dimension tables** are fundamental components of a star or snowflake schema. These tables work together to organize data in a structured, efficient way for querying, reporting, and analysis. Understanding the roles of both fact and dimension tables is crucial for designing a robust data warehouse.

### Fact Table

A **fact table** stores the **quantitative data** or **metrics** that represent the business process being analyzed. It typically contains **numerical values** (facts) such as sales amounts, revenue, profit, units sold, or quantity, and is often at the center of the star schema or snowflake schema.

#### Characteristics of a Fact Table:
- **Measures (Facts)**: The core purpose of a fact table is to hold measurable, quantitative data such as sales revenue, the number of items sold, or operational costs.
- **Foreign Keys to Dimension Tables**: The fact table contains **foreign keys** that link to related dimension tables, which provide context to the facts. These foreign keys typically reference the primary keys of the dimension tables.
- **Granularity**: The granularity of a fact table defines the level of detail captured. For example, in a sales fact table, the granularity could be at the transaction level, daily sales level, or monthly sales level. A finer granularity contains more detailed data (e.g., individual sales transactions), while a coarser granularity holds more aggregated data (e.g., daily sales totals).
- **Additive, Semi-Additive, and Non-Additive Facts**: Facts can be:
  - **Additive**: Can be summed across all dimensions (e.g., total sales).
  - **Semi-Additive**: Can be summed across some dimensions, but not others (e.g., account balances over time).
  - **Non-Additive**: Cannot be summed (e.g., percentages, ratios).

#### Example of a Fact Table:

| **Sale_ID** | **Customer_ID** | **Product_ID** | **Store_ID** | **Sale_Date**  | **Quantity** | **Revenue** |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1           | 101             | 501            | 201          | 2023-01-01     | 3            | 150         |
| 2           | 102             | 502            | 202          | 2023-01-02     | 1            | 200         |
| 3           | 101             | 503            | 201          | 2023-01-03     | 2            | 100         |

In this example:
- The **fact table** (`sales_fact`) contains **facts** like `Quantity` and `Revenue`, which represent the business metrics.
- It also includes **foreign keys** (`Customer_ID`, `Product_ID`, `Store_ID`) that link to the corresponding dimension tables.

#### Types of Fact Tables:
- **Transaction Fact Table**: Records individual transactions, such as each sale in an e-commerce system.
- **Snapshot Fact Table**: Captures data at regular intervals (e.g., monthly sales figures or inventory levels).
- **Accumulating Fact Table**: Tracks facts over the lifecycle of an event (e.g., tracking an order as it moves from processing to shipment).

### Dimension Table

A **dimension table** stores the **descriptive** or **contextual** information related to the business metrics in the fact table. Dimension tables provide the context needed for analysis by answering **who**, **what**, **when**, and **where** questions about the facts.

#### Characteristics of a Dimension Table:
- **Attributes**: Dimension tables store **descriptive attributes** about business entities, such as customer names, product categories, geographic locations, or time periods. These attributes help to filter, group, or summarize facts for reporting.
- **Primary Keys**: Each dimension table contains a **primary key**, which uniquely identifies each record in the dimension. This primary key is referenced by the foreign keys in the fact table.
- **Denormalization**: Dimension tables are often **denormalized** to reduce the number of joins needed during queries. This means the dimension table might store redundant data for better query performance.

#### Example of Dimension Tables:

**Customers Dimension Table**:
| **Customer_ID** | **Customer_Name** | **City**      | **State** |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|
| 101             | John Doe           | New York     | NY        |
| 102             | Jane Smith         | Los Angeles  | CA        |

**Products Dimension Table**:
| **Product_ID** | **Product_Name** | **Category**  | **Price** |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 501            | Laptop           | Electronics   | 50        |
| 502            | Smartphone       | Electronics   | 200       |

**Stores Dimension Table**:
| **Store_ID** | **Store_Name** | **Location**   |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| 201          | Store A        | New York       |
| 202          | Store B        | Los Angeles    |

In this example:
- The `Customer_ID` in the fact table refers to the `Customer_ID` in the `customers_dim` table, providing the customerâ€™s name and location.
- The `Product_ID` refers to the `products_dim` table, giving details like product name, category, and price.
- The `Store_ID` refers to the `stores_dim` table, identifying the store where the sale occurred.

### Relationship Between Fact and Dimension Tables

The **fact table** is typically at the center of the data model, surrounded by **dimension tables**. The fact table contains quantitative data, while the dimension tables provide descriptive data that explains the facts. This design follows the **star schema** or **snowflake schema**:

- **Star Schema**: The fact table is connected directly to dimension tables, forming a star-like structure. This is the most common and simplest schema for a data warehouse.

- **Snowflake Schema**: A more normalized version of the star schema where some dimension tables are further normalized into sub-dimensions. This reduces redundancy but may require more joins during querying.

#### Star Schema Example:

```
            +----------------+
            |  customers_dim  |
            +----------------+
                   |
                   | Customer_ID
                   |
 +-----------------+-----------------+
 |                                 | 
 |                                 |
 | Product_ID                      | Store_ID
 |                                 |
+------------+      sales_fact    +------------+
| products_dim | --------------  | stores_dim  |
+------------+                   +------------+
```

In this structure:
- The **fact table** (`sales_fact`) contains the core business metrics (sales data).
- The **dimension tables** provide descriptive context for customers, products, and stores.

### Key Differences Between Fact and Dimension Tables

| **Aspect**                 | **Fact Table**                                        | **Dimension Table**                                     |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | Stores quantitative data (business metrics).          | Stores descriptive data (attributes about entities).    |
| **Type of Data**            | Numeric, measurable data (e.g., sales, revenue, quantity). | Descriptive data (e.g., customer name, product category).|
| **Key**                     | Contains foreign keys to dimension tables.            | Contains primary keys, referenced by fact tables.       |
| **Granularity**             | Represents business events or transactions.           | Represents entities that provide context for facts.     |
| **Size**                    | Can be very large, depending on the volume of transactions. | Typically smaller than fact tables.                     |
| **Additivity**              | Facts can often be summed or aggregated.              | Attributes in dimension tables cannot be summed.        |
| **Normalization**           | Often normalized to optimize for insert operations.   | Often denormalized for faster querying.                 |

### Example Query: Joining Fact and Dimension Tables

To retrieve sales data along with customer names and product details, you can join the fact table with the dimension tables:

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    p.product_name,
    s.store_name,
    f.sale_date,
    f.quantity,
    f.revenue
FROM
    sales_fact f
JOIN
    customers_dim c ON f.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN
    products_dim p ON f.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN
    stores_dim s ON f.store_id = s.store_id
WHERE
    f.sale_date = '2023-01-01';
```

**Result**:

| **Customer_Name** | **Product_Name** | **Store_Name** | **Sale_Date** | **Quantity** | **Revenue** |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| John Doe          | Laptop           | Store A        | 2023-01-01    | 3            | 150         |

This query retrieves customer names, product details, and store names for sales that occurred on January 1, 2023, showing how fact and dimension tables work together to deliver meaningful analysis.
