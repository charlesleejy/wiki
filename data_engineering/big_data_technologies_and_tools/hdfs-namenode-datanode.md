## What is the role of HDFS NameNode and DataNode?


### Role of HDFS NameNode and DataNode

#### Overview of HDFS

- **Explanation**:
  - HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware, providing high throughput access to application data.
- **Components**:
  - The primary components of HDFS are the NameNode and DataNode.

#### NameNode

##### **A. Role and Responsibilities**
- **Explanation**:
  - The NameNode is the master node that manages the metadata and namespace of the HDFS. It does not store the actual data but keeps track of where data is stored across the cluster.
- **Key Functions**:
  - **Namespace Management**:
    - Manages the directory structure and file metadata (names, permissions, and attributes).
  - **Block Management**:
    - Keeps track of the blocks that make up a file and their locations on DataNodes.
  - **Cluster Configuration Management**:
    - Maintains the configuration information of the cluster.
  - **Operations Coordination**:
    - Coordinates file system operations such as opening, closing, and renaming files and directories.

##### **B. Metadata Storage**
- **Explanation**:
  - Stores metadata in two primary structures:
    - **Edit Log**: Logs every change that occurs to the file system metadata.
    - **FsImage**: A snapshot of the file system metadata at a point in time.

##### **C. Fault Tolerance and High Availability**
- **Explanation**:
  - Implements mechanisms for fault tolerance and high availability.
- **Mechanisms**:
  - **Secondary NameNode**:
    - Periodically merges the Edit Log with the FsImage to prevent the Edit Log from growing indefinitely.
  - **Checkpointing**:
    - Regularly creates checkpoints to ensure the NameNode can recover quickly in case of a failure.

##### **D. Handling Client Requests**
- **Explanation**:
  - Handles client requests such as file creation, deletion, and block replication.
- **Client Interaction**:
  - **File Creation**:
    - When a file is created, the NameNode allocates blocks for the file and records the metadata.
  - **File Reading**:
    - Provides the list of DataNodes that contain the blocks of a file when a client requests to read a file.

#### DataNode

##### **A. Role and Responsibilities**
- **Explanation**:
  - DataNodes are the worker nodes that store the actual data blocks. They are responsible for serving read and write requests from clients and performing block creation, deletion, and replication based on instructions from the NameNode.
- **Key Functions**:
  - **Block Storage**:
    - Stores the actual data blocks on the local file system.
  - **Block Reporting**:
    - Periodically sends block reports to the NameNode to provide the status of block storage.
  - **Heartbeat**:
    - Sends heartbeat signals to the NameNode to confirm its availability and health.

##### **B. Data Storage**
- **Explanation**:
  - Stores data in blocks, typically 128 MB in size.
- **Data Integrity**:
  - Uses checksums to verify data integrity and detect any corruption.

##### **C. Replication Management**
- **Explanation**:
  - Manages block replication to ensure data availability and fault tolerance.
- **Replication Process**:
  - Replicates data blocks to other DataNodes based on the replication factor specified by the NameNode.

##### **D. Handling Client Requests**
- **Explanation**:
  - Serves data read and write requests from clients.
- **Client Interaction**:
  - **File Reading**:
    - Reads data blocks and streams them to the client.
  - **File Writing**:
    - Writes data blocks received from the client and reports back to the NameNode upon completion.

#### Interaction Between NameNode and DataNode

##### **A. Block Management**
- **Explanation**:
  - NameNode instructs DataNodes on where to store replicas of each block.
- **Block Reports**:
  - DataNodes periodically send block reports to the NameNode, ensuring the NameNode has up-to-date information on block locations.

##### **B. Heartbeats**
- **Explanation**:
  - DataNodes send heartbeats to the NameNode to indicate they are functioning properly.
- **Failure Detection**:
  - If the NameNode does not receive a heartbeat from a DataNode within a specified timeframe, it considers the DataNode to have failed and initiates block replication from other DataNodes.

##### **C. Data Replication**
- **Explanation**:
  - Ensures data redundancy and fault tolerance by replicating data blocks across multiple DataNodes.
- **Replication Factor**:
  - Configurable parameter that determines the number of replicas for each block (default is 3).

#### Summary

**NameNode**:
1. **Role and Responsibilities**:
   - Manages metadata and namespace.
   - Coordinates file system operations.
2. **Metadata Storage**:
   - Edit Log and FsImage.
3. **Fault Tolerance and High Availability**:
   - Secondary NameNode and checkpointing.
4. **Handling Client Requests**:
   - File creation, deletion, and block replication coordination.

**DataNode**:
1. **Role and Responsibilities**:
   - Stores actual data blocks.
   - Serves read/write requests and manages block replication.
2. **Data Storage**:
   - Stores data in blocks with checksums for integrity.
3. **Replication Management**:
   - Manages block replication to ensure availability.
4. **Handling Client Requests**:
   - Reads data blocks for clients and writes received data blocks.

**Interaction Between NameNode and DataNode**:
1. **Block Management**:
   - NameNode instructs DataNodes on block storage.
2. **Heartbeats**:
   - DataNodes send heartbeats for health checks.
3. **Data Replication**:
   - Ensures data redundancy through replication.

By efficiently managing metadata and actual data storage separately, the NameNode and DataNodes collectively ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient data access in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
