## Describe the architecture of Apache Cassandra.


### Architecture of Apache Cassandra

#### 1. Overview

##### **A. Definition**
- **Explanation**:
  - Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers without a single point of failure.

##### **B. Use Cases**
- **Explanation**:
  - Ideal for high-availability systems that require fault tolerance and can handle write-intensive workloads.
- **Examples**:
  - Social media platforms, IoT applications, and time-series data storage.

#### 2. Core Components

##### **A. Node**
- **Explanation**:
  - The basic unit of data storage in Cassandra. Each node stores a part of the dataset and can handle read and write requests independently.

##### **B. Cluster**
- **Explanation**:
  - A collection of nodes. Cassandra’s architecture allows it to easily scale out by adding more nodes to the cluster.

##### **C. Data Center**
- **Explanation**:
  - A collection of related nodes within a cluster, often corresponding to a physical data center location. Data centers improve fault tolerance and data locality.

##### **D. Commit Log**
- **Explanation**:
  - Each write operation is first recorded in the commit log to ensure durability. In case of a crash, the data can be recovered from the commit log.

##### **E. Memtable**
- **Explanation**:
  - An in-memory structure where write operations are stored after being written to the commit log. It acts as a write-back cache.

##### **F. SSTable (Sorted String Table)**
- **Explanation**:
  - Immutable data files stored on disk. Once the memtable reaches a certain size, it is flushed to an SSTable.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Immutable and append-only. This ensures fast writes and reduces the need for locks.

##### **G. Bloom Filter**
- **Explanation**:
  - A probabilistic data structure used to quickly determine if a key is present in an SSTable. Helps in reducing the number of disk I/O operations.

##### **H. Hinted Handoff**
- **Explanation**:
  - A mechanism to ensure write availability even when a node is down. The coordinator node will store a hint and forward it to the intended node once it comes back online.

#### 3. Data Distribution and Replication

##### **A. Partition Key**
- **Explanation**:
  - Determines how data is distributed across the cluster. The hash of the partition key decides the node that will store the data.
- **Example**:
  - If the partition key is `user_id`, the hash of `user_id` will determine the node where the user's data is stored.

##### **B. Consistent Hashing**
- **Explanation**:
  - Distributes data evenly across all nodes using a hash function. Each node is assigned a range of the hash value.

##### **C. Replication**
- **Explanation**:
  - Data is replicated across multiple nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. The replication factor determines the number of copies of the data.
- **Example**:
  - With a replication factor of 3, each piece of data is stored on three different nodes.

#### 4. Read and Write Path

##### **A. Write Path**
- **Steps**:
  1. **Commit Log**: Write operation is logged for durability.
  2. **Memtable**: Data is written to an in-memory table.
  3. **SSTable**: Once the memtable is full, it is flushed to disk as an SSTable.
- **Explanation**:
  - This ensures fast writes and high availability.

##### **B. Read Path**
- **Steps**:
  1. **Memtable**: Check if the data is present in the memtable.
  2. **Bloom Filter**: Use the bloom filter to check SSTables for the presence of the data.
  3. **SSTable**: Retrieve data from the relevant SSTable(s).
- **Explanation**:
  - This multi-step approach ensures efficient read operations by minimizing disk I/O.

#### 5. Consistency and Availability

##### **A. Consistency Levels**
- **Explanation**:
  - Cassandra offers tunable consistency levels to balance between consistency and availability.
- **Types**:
  - **ANY**: Ensures the write is successful if any node responds.
  - **ONE**: Requires at least one node to respond.
  - **QUORUM**: Requires a majority of nodes to respond.
  - **ALL**: Requires all nodes to respond.
  
##### **B. CAP Theorem**
- **Explanation**:
  - Cassandra is designed to be highly available and partition-tolerant, with tunable consistency.
- **Implications**:
  - It allows users to choose the consistency level based on their application’s requirements.

#### 6. Fault Tolerance and Repair

##### **A. Data Replication**
- **Explanation**:
  - Data is replicated across multiple nodes and data centers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Mechanism**:
  - The replication factor determines how many copies of the data exist.

##### **B. Repair Mechanisms**
- **Explanation**:
  - Regular repair operations are necessary to ensure data consistency across replicas.
- **Types**:
  - **Anti-Entropy Repair**: Ensures all replicas have the most recent data.
  - **Read Repair**: Ensures consistency during read operations by comparing data across replicas and updating if necessary.
