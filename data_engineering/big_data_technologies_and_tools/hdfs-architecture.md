## Explain the architecture of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).


### Architecture of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

#### Overview
- **HDFS**: A distributed file system designed to store large datasets reliably and to stream those data sets at high bandwidth to user applications.
- **Components**: Composed of NameNode, DataNodes, and various supporting components.

#### Core Components

1. **NameNode**
   - **Role**: The master server that manages the file system namespace and regulates access to files by clients.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - **Metadata Management**: Maintains the file system tree and the metadata for all the files and directories. This includes file permissions, modification/access times, and the mapping of files to data blocks.
     - **Namespace Operations**: Handles operations like opening, closing, and renaming files and directories.
     - **Block Management**: Maps file blocks to DataNodes and manages block replication for fault tolerance.
   - **Storage**:
     - **FsImage**: Stores the entire file system namespace and file-block mapping.
     - **EditLog**: Logs every change made to the file system metadata.

2. **DataNodes**
   - **Role**: The worker nodes that store the actual data blocks.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - **Block Storage**: Stores blocks of HDFS files and provides read/write access to these blocks for clients.
     - **Block Reporting**: Periodically sends reports to the NameNode about the blocks it is storing.
     - **Replication Management**: Participates in block replication, receiving instructions from the NameNode to copy, delete, or move blocks to achieve the desired replication factor.
   - **Communication**:
     - **Heartbeat**: Sends periodic heartbeat messages to the NameNode to indicate that it is functioning properly.

#### Supporting Components

1. **Secondary NameNode**
   - **Role**: Assists the NameNode in managing the file system metadata but is not a backup NameNode.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - **Checkpointing**: Periodically merges the EditLog with the FsImage to produce an updated FsImage, which helps reduce the size of the EditLog and makes the NameNode's recovery process faster.

#### File Storage Process

1. **File Splitting**:
   - **Process**: When a file is written to HDFS, it is split into blocks (default size: 128 MB) and stored across multiple DataNodes.
   - **Example**:
     - A 300 MB file is split into three blocks: Block A (128 MB), Block B (128 MB), and Block C (44 MB).

2. **Replication**:
   - **Purpose**: Ensures data availability and fault tolerance by replicating each block to multiple DataNodes (default replication factor: 3).
   - **Placement Policy**: 
     - First replica: Stored on the DataNode where the client is writing the data.
     - Second replica: Stored on a different rack for redundancy.
     - Third replica: Stored on a different DataNode within the same rack as the second replica.

#### Read and Write Operations

1. **Write Operation**:
   - **Client Interaction**: Client interacts with the NameNode to create a new file and get a list of DataNodes for block placement.
   - **Data Transfer**: Data is written to the selected DataNode, which then replicates the blocks to other DataNodes as instructed by the NameNode.
   - **Metadata Update**: NameNode updates the metadata to reflect the new file and its block locations.

2. **Read Operation**:
   - **Client Request**: Client requests the file from the NameNode.
   - **Metadata Retrieval**: NameNode provides the client with the list of DataNodes storing the blocks of the requested file.
   - **Data Access**: Client reads the blocks directly from the respective DataNodes.

#### Fault Tolerance and Recovery

1. **Heartbeat and Block Reports**:
   - **Heartbeat**: DataNodes send periodic heartbeats to the NameNode to confirm their health status.
   - **Block Reports**: DataNodes periodically send block reports to the NameNode, listing all blocks they are storing.

2. **DataNode Failure**:
   - **Detection**: If the NameNode does not receive a heartbeat from a DataNode within a specified time (default: 10 minutes), it marks the DataNode as dead.
   - **Replication**: The NameNode initiates the replication of blocks stored on the failed DataNode to other DataNodes to maintain the replication factor.

3. **NameNode Failure**:
   - **FsImage and EditLog**: Stored on persistent storage to facilitate NameNode recovery.
   - **Secondary NameNode**: Helps in checkpointing but does not provide high availability; additional solutions like HDFS High Availability (HA) are required for true redundancy.

#### HDFS High Availability (HA)

1. **Active and Standby NameNodes**:
   - **Active NameNode**: Handles all client requests and metadata management.
   - **Standby NameNode**: Keeps a copy of the metadata and is ready to take over if the active NameNode fails.
   - **Automatic Failover**: Uses a failover controller to automatically switch between active and standby NameNodes in case of failure.

2. **Shared Storage**:
   - **EditLog**: Shared between active and standby NameNodes to ensure both have the same metadata.

### Summary

- **Core Components**:
  - **NameNode**: Manages metadata and file system namespace.
  - **DataNodes**: Store actual data blocks.
  - **Secondary NameNode**: Assists in metadata checkpointing.

- **File Storage Process**:
  - **File Splitting**: Divides files into blocks.
  - **Replication**: Ensures fault tolerance by replicating blocks across multiple DataNodes.

- **Read and Write Operations**:
  - **Write Operation**: Client writes data, which is split into blocks and replicated.
  - **Read Operation**: Client reads data directly from DataNodes.

- **Fault Tolerance and Recovery**:
  - **Heartbeat and Block Reports**: Monitors DataNode health and block status.
  - **DataNode Failure**: Detected by missing heartbeats; triggers block replication.
  - **NameNode Failure**: Requires metadata recovery and potential use of HDFS High Availability.

- **HDFS High Availability (HA)**:
  - **Active and Standby NameNodes**: Ensure continuous operation with automatic failover.

HDFS provides a robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant storage system essential for handling large-scale data processing in a distributed environment.
