- **Example**:
  - Very large social networks or IoT datasets with billions of nodes and edges.

##### **C. Write-Heavy Workloads**
- **Explanation**:
  - Graph databases are often optimized for read-heavy operations.
- **Challenges**:
  - Write-heavy workloads can lead to performance bottlenecks.
  - Requires tuning and optimization for high write throughput.
- **Example**:
  - Real-time analytics where data is continuously ingested at high rates.

##### **D. Complexity in Distributed Systems**
- **Explanation**:
  - Distributing graph data across multiple nodes can introduce complexity.
- **Challenges**:
  - Ensuring data consistency and efficient query performance in a distributed setup.
  - Complexity in sharding and rebalancing the graph.
- **Example**:
  - Global applications with nodes spread across multiple data centers.

##### **E. Cost**
- **Explanation**:
  - Licensing and operational costs for Neo4j can be significant.
- **Challenges**:
  - Cost of enterprise features and support can be high.
  - Requires budgeting for hardware, licensing, and maintenance.
