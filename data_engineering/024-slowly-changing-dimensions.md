## 24. What are slowly changing dimensions (SCD), and how do you handle them?


### How to Design a Data Warehouse for Scalability and Performance

#### 1. **Define Business Requirements**

- **Identify Key Metrics**: Determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that the business needs to track.
- **Understand Data Sources**: Identify and understand the data sources and their formats (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).
- **Determine Query Patterns**: Analyze the expected query patterns, including frequency, complexity, and concurrency.

#### 2. **Choose the Right Architecture**

- **Star Schema**: Simplifies queries and improves performance with denormalized dimension tables around a central fact table.
- **Snowflake Schema**: Normalizes dimension tables to reduce redundancy but can be more complex and require additional joins.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine elements of both star and snowflake schemas based on specific use cases and data complexity.

#### 3. **Data Partitioning**

- **Horizontal Partitioning**: Split large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces based on a range of values (e.g., date range).
  - **Example**: Partitioning a sales table by month or year.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE sales (
      sale_id INT,
      sale_date DATE,
      amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
  ) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(sale_date)) (
      PARTITION p2020 VALUES LESS THAN (2021),
      PARTITION p2021 VALUES LESS THAN (2022)
  );
  ```

- **Vertical Partitioning**: Split a table into multiple tables that contain fewer columns.
  - **Example**: Separating frequently accessed columns from rarely accessed ones.

#### 4. **Indexing**

- **Create Indexes**: Use indexes on columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses.
  - **Example**: Index on the customer_id column in the sales table.
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON sales(customer_id);
  ```

- **Composite Indexes**: Create composite indexes for queries involving multiple columns.
  - **Example**: Index on (customer_id, sale_date).
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_customer_sale_date ON sales(customer_id, sale_date);
  ```

#### 5. **Data Aggregation**

- **Materialized Views**: Use materialized views to store precomputed aggregates for faster query performance.
  - **Example**: A materialized view for monthly sales totals.
  ```sql
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales AS
  SELECT 
      customer_id, 
      DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS sale_month,
      SUM(amount) AS total_sales
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY customer_id, sale_month;
  ```

- **Summary Tables**: Create summary tables to store aggregated data for common queries.

#### 6. **ETL Optimization**

- **Incremental Loading**: Load only new or changed data to minimize load times and resource usage.
- **Parallel Processing**: Use parallel processing to speed up data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **Batch Processing**: Schedule ETL processes during off-peak hours to reduce the impact on system performance.

#### 7. **Data Compression**

- **Compression Techniques**: Use compression techniques to reduce storage requirements and improve I/O performance.
  - **Example**: Using columnar storage formats like Parquet or ORC for large tables.

#### 8. **Caching**

- **Query Caching**: Cache results of frequent queries to reduce load on the data warehouse.
- **In-Memory Storage**: Use in-memory storage for high-speed access to frequently accessed data.

#### 9. **Load Balancing**

- **Distribute Load**: Distribute the query load across multiple servers or nodes to balance the workload.
- **Use Load Balancers**: Implement load balancers to manage and distribute incoming queries.

#### 10. **Data Governance**

- **Metadata Management**: Maintain comprehensive metadata to manage data lineage, quality, and usage.
- **Data Quality Checks**: Implement data quality checks to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data.

#### 11. **Monitoring and Maintenance**

- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the performance of the data warehouse and identify bottlenecks.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Perform regular maintenance tasks like updating statistics, rebuilding indexes, and cleaning up fragmented data.

#### 12. **Scalability Considerations**

- **Scale-Out**: Add more nodes or servers to the data warehouse to handle increased load (horizontal scaling).
- **Scale-Up**: Increase the resources (CPU, RAM, storage) of existing nodes to handle increased load (vertical scaling).
- **Cloud Services**: Leverage cloud-based data warehouse solutions for dynamic scaling and resource management.

### Example Design Considerations

1. **Schema Design**:
   - Use a star schema for simple, high-performance queries.
   - Use a snowflake schema for complex, normalized data structures.

2. **Indexing Strategy**:
   - Create indexes on foreign keys and columns used in filters and joins.
   - Use composite indexes for multi-column queries.

3. **Partitioning Strategy**:
   - Partition large tables by date or other key columns to improve query performance.

4. **ETL Optimization**:
   - Use parallel processing and incremental loading to optimize ETL performance.

5. **Aggregation Strategy**:
   - Use materialized views and summary tables for frequently aggregated data.

### Summary

- **Define Business Requirements**: Understand metrics, data sources, and query patterns.
- **Choose the Right Architecture**: Star, snowflake, or hybrid schemas.
- **Data Partitioning**: Horizontal and vertical partitioning for manageability.
- **Indexing**: Create and manage indexes for key columns.
- **Data Aggregation**: Use materialized views and summary tables.
- **ETL Optimization**: Incremental loading, parallel processing, batch processing.
- **Data Compression**: Use compression techniques to save space and improve I/O.
- **Caching**: Implement query caching and in-memory storage.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across multiple servers.
- **Data Governance**: Ensure data quality and metadata management.
