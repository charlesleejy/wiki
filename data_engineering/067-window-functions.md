## 67. Describe the concept of window functions in data processing.


### Concept of Window Functions in Data Processing

#### Definition

- **Window Functions**: Window functions, also known as analytic functions, are SQL functions that perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, window functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output rowâ€”the rows retain their separate identities.

#### Key Components of Window Functions

1. **OVER Clause**:
   - **Description**: Specifies the window or set of rows over which the function operates.
   - **Example**: `OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)`

2. **PARTITION BY**:
   - **Description**: Divides the result set into partitions to which the window function is applied.
   - **Example**: `PARTITION BY department`

3. **ORDER BY**:
   - **Description**: Defines the logical order of rows within each partition for the window function computation.
   - **Example**: `ORDER BY salary DESC`

4. **Window Frame**:
   - **Description**: Specifies the subset of rows within the partition to be considered for each row's calculations.
   - **Frame Options**: `ROWS` or `RANGE`, with bounds like `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`, `CURRENT ROW`, `N FOLLOWING`.
   - **Example**: `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`

#### Types of Window Functions

1. **Ranking Functions**:
   - **Description**: Assigns a rank to each row within the partition.
   - **Functions**:
     - `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition.
     - `RANK()`: Assigns a rank with gaps for tied values.
     - `DENSE_RANK()`: Assigns a rank without gaps for tied values.
     - `NTILE(n)`: Divides the rows into `n` approximately equal groups.

2. **Aggregate Functions**:
   - **Description**: Applies aggregate calculations over the window.
   - **Functions**:
     - `SUM()`: Calculates the sum of values.
     - `AVG()`: Calculates the average of values.
     - `MIN()`: Finds the minimum value.
     - `MAX()`: Finds the maximum value.
     - `COUNT()`: Counts the number of values.

3. **Value Functions**:
   - **Description**: Provides access to values from other rows within the window.
   - **Functions**:
     - `LAG()`: Returns the value from a preceding row.
     - `LEAD()`: Returns the value from a following row.
     - `FIRST_VALUE()`: Returns the first value in the window frame.
     - `LAST_VALUE()`: Returns the last value in the window frame.
     - `NTH_VALUE()`: Returns the value of the `n`-th row in the window frame.

#### Importance of Window Functions

1. **Enhanced Analytical Capabilities**:
   - **Description**: Allows complex calculations that are not possible with regular aggregate functions.
   - **Benefit**: Provides deeper insights and more granular analysis.

2. **Non-Aggregative Calculations**:
   - **Description**: Performs calculations without collapsing rows into groups.
   - **Benefit**: Maintains the detail of the dataset while adding additional computed columns.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - **Description**: Combines the power of aggregation with row-level detail.
   - **Benefit**: Supports a wide range of analytical scenarios.

4. **Improved Readability and Maintainability**:
   - **Description**: Simplifies SQL queries by reducing the need for complex joins and subqueries.
   - **Benefit**: Makes SQL code easier to understand and maintain.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **Description**: Often optimized by SQL engines for efficient computation.
   - **Benefit**: Enhances query performance compared to manual row-based computations.

#### Use Cases of Window Functions

1. **Running Totals and Moving Averages**:
   - **Example**: Calculating cumulative sales or a moving average of stock prices.

2. **Rankings and Percentiles**:
   - **Example**: Ranking employees by performance or calculating percentiles for exam scores.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - **Example**: Comparing current row values with previous or next row values, such as month-over-month growth.

4. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - **Example**: Analyzing trends over time by partitioning data by time periods.

5. **Data Gaps and Islands**:
   - **Example**: Identifying sequences of continuous events or gaps in time series data.

#### Examples of Window Functions

1. **ROW_NUMBER()**:
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
     FROM employees;
     ```

2. **SUM()**:
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
            SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS total_salary
     FROM employees;
     ```

3. **LAG()**:
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
            LAG(salary, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS previous_salary
     FROM employees;
     ```

4. **RANK()**:
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
            RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
     FROM employees;
     ```
